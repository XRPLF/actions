            Maybe you did not enable 'pre-commit' hooks in your local repository?

            To install the `pre-commit` hooks, run: `pre-commit install`

            To run `pre-commit` hooks on all files, run 'pre-commit run --all-files' in the repo.
            Then commit and push the changes.
        run: |
          set +e
          pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color always
          rc=$?
          set -e

          if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
            # Print the files that changed to give the contributor a hint about
            # what to expect when running `pre-commit` on their own machine.
            git status
            echo "${MESSAGE}"
